<h1> Why We NEED to Save the Penguins </h1>

<p> Penguins are in danger for a variety of reasons. Many of those reasons are man made. No matter how much we need oil, we cannot look over the fact that oil spills spell disaster for animals.  The Deepwater Horizon, an oil rig located in the Gulf of Mexico, exploded in April of 2010. In just 6 months over 8,000 animals died. Many of the animals that died were endangered. In 2011 a cargo ship carrying crude oil crashed on Nightingale Island in the remote British South Atlantic region. It ended up releasing over 800 tons of toxic fuel oil into the sea waters. That island was home to over 200,000 penguins. This territory contains nearly half of the world’s population of northern rockhopper penguins, a species that has been endangered for many years. This problem is one of many that needs to be fixed by the people who caused it to happen in the first. </p>

<h2> What are the health risks asscociated with oil spills? </h2>
<p> The birds are often in poor shape and dehydrated. When the penguin begins to preen its feathers in an attempt to remove the oil, the toxic material is ingested, causing damage to the bird’s internal organs. Surviving birds may be severely injured with oil coating their skin and feathers. It contains deadly chemicals that burns their skin. The sticky oil is heavy and affects the buoyancy of the bird. This makes it difficult for the bird to swim and move about freely. This could be dangerous if they need to get food as they could die from starvation.</p>

<h2> How you can help </h2>
<p> There are many ways to help without even traveling to the locations of spills. You can donate money to relief funds that would go in and rescue the penguins. You can also adopt a penguin meaning you pay money monthly to provide care for them such as food and the price to house them. It costs 25 dollars to help 2 penguin families. The penguins don't always have time. Donating increases their chance of surival. If you do personally go out to save the penguins there are many thing you need to remember. The animals just went through a tragic experience. So you need to be gentle. You need to wash the animals using hot water and dish soap but some of them won't be ready to be washed. So are YOU ready to help?
